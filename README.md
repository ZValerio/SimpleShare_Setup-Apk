SIMPLESHARE USER MANUAL
-------------------------------------------

Thank you for installing SimpleShare! Below are some key instructions to help you get started:

1. **Select the Path File:**
   At the top-right corner of the SimpleShare interface, you'll find a drop-down menu. This menu allows you to select the path of the file you want to work with. Each time you open the application, you will need to specify the path by selecting the file through this menu. (DEFAULT: Download Folder)

2. **File Transfer:**
   To transfer files, you need to use the IP address shown by the server. Both devices (the sender and the receiver) must be on the **same network** to ensure a successful file transfer. If devices are on different networks , the receiver must do port-forwarding to his device and sender must use public ip of the target.

3. **Encryption:**
   Encryption is selected by default. When it's enabled the connection uses SSL protocol so bytes are crypted between users. If Encription is disabled, data travels in cleartext, but the transfer is faster.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

Thank you for using SimpleShare!
